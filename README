NAME
    Statistics::CalinskiHarabasz - Perl extension to the cluster stopping
    rule proposed by Calinski and Harabasz (C&H)

SYNOPSIS
      use Statistics::CalinskiHarabasz;
      &ch(InputFile, "agglo", 10);

      Input file is expected in the "dense" format -
      Sample Input file:
   
      6 5
      1       1       0       0       1
      1       0       0       0       0
      1       1       0       0       1
      1       1       0       0       1
      1       0       0       0       1
      1       1       0       0       1             

DESCRIPTION
    C&H use the Variance Ratio Criterion which is analogous to F-Statistics
    to estimate the number of clusters a given data naturally falls into.
    They minimize Within Cluster/Group Sum of Squares (WGSS) and maximize
    Between Cluster/Group Sum of Squares (BGSS)

  EXPORT
    "ch" function by default.

INPUT
  InputFile
    The input dataset is expected in "dense" matrix format. The input dense
    matrix is expected in a plain text file where the first line in the file
    gives the dimensions of the dataset and then the dataset in a matrix
    format should follow. The contexts / observations should be along the
    rows and the features should be along the column.

            eg:
            6 5
            1       1       0       0       1
            1       0       0       0       0
            1       1       0       0       1
            1       1       0       0       1
            1       0       0       0       1
            1       1       0       0       1       

    The first line (6 5) gives the number of rows (observations) and the
    number of columns (features) present in the following matrix. Following
    each line records the frequency of occurrence of the feature at the
    column in the given observation. Thus features1 (1st column) occurs once
    in the observation1 and infact once in all the other observations too
    while the feature3 does not occur in observation1.

  ClusteringMethod
    The Clustering Measures that can be used are: 1. rb - Repeated
    Bisections [Default] 2. rbr - Repeated Bisections for by k-way
    refinement 3. direct - Direct k-way clustering 4. agglo - Agglomerative
    clustering 5. graph - Graph partitioning-based clustering 6. bagglo -
    Partitional biased Agglomerative clustering

  K value
    This is an approximate upper bound for the number of clusters that may
    be present in the dataset. Thus for a dataset that you expect to be
    seperated into 3 clusters this value should be set some integer value
    greater than 3.

OUTPUT
    A single integer number which is the estimate of number of clusters
    present in the input dataset.

PRE-REQUISITES
    1. This module uses suite of C programs called CLUTO for clustering
    purposes. Thus CLUTO needs to be installed for this module to be
    functional. CLUTO can be downloaded from
    http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~karypis/cluto/
